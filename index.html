Perhaps, you'll be able to feed the chickens with us. Don't worry if you don't know how to feed chickens. We'll teach you! Yes, we will. I'm glad we've something cool to do this weekend. Also, we'll be helping Mr. Kevin fix his barn. It'll be so much fun and it wouldn't be as much fun if you didn't come along too. Off to the farm we go! Oh, I can't wait! I can't wait!! I can feel so much fun ahead.</mark-the-words></div><script type="module" src="./fd566fa7.js"></script><script inject-service-worker="">"serviceWorker"in navigator&&window.addEventListener("load",(function(){navigator.serviceWorker.register("sw.js").then((function(){console.log('ServiceWorker registered from "sw.js".')})).catch((function(e){console.log("ServiceWorker registration failed: ",e)}))}))</script></body></html>
