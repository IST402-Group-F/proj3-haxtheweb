      It'll be a great day at the farm and you should come too. Perhaps, you'll be able
      to feed the chickens with us. Don't worry if you don't know how to feed chickens.
      We'll teach you! Yes, we will. I'm glad we've something cool to do this
      weekend. Also, we'll be helping Mr. Kevin fix his barn. It'll be so much fun and it
      wouldn't be as much fun if you didn't come along too. Off to the farm we go!
      Oh, I can't wait! I can't wait!! I can feel so much fun ahead.
